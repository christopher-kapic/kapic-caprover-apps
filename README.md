## CapRover One-Click Apps

I am working on adding One-Click Apps to the standard [repo](https://github.com/caprover/one-click-apps), but for testing or the case that an app is not accepted, One-Click Apps will be available here. Once an app is accepted into the standard repo, I will remove it from this one to avoid having duplicates.

You can add new repository URLs to the one click app page. This one, is available as `https://kaprover.netlify.app`.

Apps names :{name} use `container:latest` and are therefore unfit for being added to the main repo. This is done to ensure that containers use their most up-to-date build, but there is no guarantee that the latest builds work.
